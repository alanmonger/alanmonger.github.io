<h2>Sending Messages Across the Battlefield</h2>
<p>
    For thousands of years people have been trying to hiding information. The
    Nazis had the Enigma, Julius Caesar used a Caesar Cipher, the Freemasons
    had the Pigpen Cipher, and Mary Queen of Scots used a substitution cipher
    alphabet while imprisioned by her cousin.
</p>
<p>
    The Caesar Cipher was particularly weak, as letters were just shifted three
    places to obscure the message. While initially useful, once discovered the
    messages could be easily intersepted.
</p>
<p>
    The Freemasons used the Pigpen Cipher. This substituted letters for symbols,
    which allowed easy hiding of messages. Though once the codebook was
    discovered, the messages transmitted could again be easily intersepted.
</p>
<p>
    Mary Queen of Scots was imprisioned by her cousin (Queen Elisabeth I) for
    plotting to take the throne. She, and her Catholic supporters were in
    communication where she consented to the assasination of the Protestant
    Queen. Little did she know, she responded directly to Elisabeth's spymaster,
    who had already broken the code.
</p>
<p>
    The issue with these forms of communication, is both parties need to agree
    beforehand how they are going to hide the information. While these examples
    use substituions, symmetric ciphers use keys which are traded, which allow
    the sender and recipient to communicate.
